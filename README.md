### Bulking Phase Monday, January 17 - May 10

1. Calculate Basal Metabolism - Mifflin St Jeor Formula Method

Formula: [10*weight(kg) + 6.25*height(cm) - 5 * age] + 5 

The result will be the Basal Metabolism (for Men) - The energy that the body requires for completing basic functions. 

2. Activity Factor

Formula = Basal Metabolism * Activity Factor

Activity Factor: an estimation of how much physical activity we do per week:
       * Sedentary Activity: Basal Metabolism * 1.2
       * Light Activity (walk 1-3 times per week): Basal Metabolism * 1.375
       * Moderate Activity (swim or lifting | 3-5 times per week): Basal Metabolism * 1.55
       * Intense Activity : Basal Metabolism * 1.725
       
The result will be the Total Energetic Expenditure (TEE) in calories per day.     

3. Define the goal and calculate Total Calories.

If Caloric Deficit -> TEE - y | where x<500 (250-300 preferred)
If Caloric Surplus --> TEE + y | where 100<y>151 
If Body Recomposition ---> TEE - y | where y < 150
    
4. Macronutrients
    
    Protein: 1.4g-1.8g per kg | For over 1.6g per kg do not show beneficial results for the average person. | total_caloric_protein: * 4
    
    Fat: 20%-25% of calories| hormonal importance | to obtain this, we will (TEE * 0.25) / 9 calories = total fat grams per day.
    
    Carbs: TEE - total_caloric_protein - Fat = rest_calories
    rest_calories / 4 cal = total_caloric_carbs
